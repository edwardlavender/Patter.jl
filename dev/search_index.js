In our applications, map is often a bathymetry raster that defines the depth of the seabed across the study area. map is an essential field in individual movement models (see ModelMove). The internal extract() function supports the simulation of initial states (via simulate_states_init()) and the updating of states (via simulate_step()), as required to simulate animal movement paths (e.g., in simulate_path_walk() and particle_filter()). Individual states define, at a minimum, the individual's location (x, y) and the value of the map at that location (map_value), which is extracted by extract() (see State). The Coordinate Reference Systems for map, x and y must align for this to work (i.e., map should use a Universal Transverse Mercator projection with coordinates in metres). extract() is exported so that it can be used in new methods (for custom states or movement models) of these functions. The simulation of individual movements (via simulate_step()) is implemented iteratively (via simulate_move()) until a valid movement is found. NaN is taken to define inhospitable habitats, such as land, into which the individual cannot move (see is_valid()). It should be possible to use a map in another format (such as a shapefile) within these routines, with a custom extract() method that returns NaN in inhospitable habitats and a numeric constant otherwise. \n\nReturns\n\nThe value of the GeoArray for a coordinate pair within the bounds of map;\nNaN (of the same type as map's elements) for a coordinate pair beyond the bounds of map;\n\nSee also\n\nState for State sub-types;\nextract to extract values from map at State coordinates;\nsimulate_step() to simulate a new State;\nis_valid() to determine whether or not a simulated state is valid;\nsimulate_move() to simulate states iteratively until a valid state is found;\nsimulate_path_walk() and particle_filter() for the front-end functions that use these routines to simulate animal movement paths;\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#Patter.is_valid","page":"Patter.jl","title":"Patter.is_valid","text":"is_valid(map_value::Real)\nis_valid(map_value::Real, z::Real)\n\nDetermine the validity of a point on a map.\n\nFor two-dimensional (x, y) states, is_valid(map_value) checks if the map_value (at a point (x, y)) is not NaN.\n\nFor states with a depth (z) component, is_valid(map_value, z), checks that map_value is not NaN and that the provided z-coordinate (z) lies within the valid range, specifically 0 < z ≤ map_value (i.e., the animal is not below the seabed).\n\nArguments\n\nmap_value: The value of the map in a particular location;\nz: (optional) The z-coordinate (depth) of the animal, used for states that contain a depth component only;\n\nDetails\n\nThese are internal functions.

See simulate_states_init() to simulate initial states for the filter.  \n\nMovement\n\nFor every time step in the timeline, the internal function simulate_move() simulates the movement of particles away from previous States into new States using the movement model, as specified by model_move. simulate_move() is an iterative wrapper for a simulate_step() method that simulates a new State instance from the previous State. simulate_move() implements simulate_step() iteratively until a legal move is found (or n_move is reached). For custom State or ModelObs sub-types, a corresponding simulate_step() method is required. Illegal moves are those that land in NaN locations on the map or, in the case of States that include a depth (z) component, are below the depth of the seabed (see is_valid()). Particles that fail to generate legal moves are eventually killed by re-sampling (see below).\n\nLikelihood\n\nObservations are used to weight simulated particles. To simulate observations for filtering, use simulate_yobs(). To assemble real-world observations for filtering, see assemble_yobs(). For each valid State and time stamp in yobs, the log-probability of each observation, given the State, is evaluated via logpdf_obs(). For custom State or ModelObs sub-types, a corresponding logpdf_obs() method is required. The maximum log-probability across all particles is recorded at each time step as an algorithm diagnostic.\n\nResampling\n\nParticles are periodically re-sampled, with replacement, using the low-variance systematic re-sampling algorithm (via resample()), when the effective sample size is less than or equal to n_resample. This has the effect of eliminating impossible particles and duplicating likely ones.\n\nThe algorithm continues in this way, iterating over the timeline, simulating, weighting and (re)sampling particles. At each time step, n_record particles are saved in memory. If the function fails to converge, a warning is returned alongside the outputs up to that time step. Otherwise, the function will continue to the end of the time series.\n\nMulti-threading\n\nThe iteration over particles (i.e., simulated movements and likelihood evaluations) are multi-threaded. \n\nConvergence and diagnostics\n\nAlgorithm convergence is not guaranteed. The algorithm may reach a dead-end–-a time step at which there are no valid locations into which the algorithm can step. This may be due to data errors, incorrect assumptions, insufficient sampling effort or poor tuning-parameter settings.\n\nReturns\n\nA NamedTuple with the following fields:\ntimesteps: An Vector{Int64} of time steps;\ntimestamps: The timeline;\ndirection: The direction;\nstate: A Matrix of States:\nEach row corresponds to a particle; \nEach column corresponds to the timestep;\ness: A Vector{Float64} that defines the effective sample size at each time step;\nmaxlp: A Vector{Float64} that defines the maximum log-posterior at each time step;\nconvergence: A Boolian that defines whether or not the algorithm reached the end of the timeline;\n\nSee also\n\nState, ModelMove and ModelObs for State, movement model and observation model sub-types;\nsimulate_yobs() and assemble_yobs() to prepare observations for the particle filter;\nsimulate_step() and simulate_move() for the internal routines used to simulate new States;\nlogpdf_obs() methods to evaluate the log probability of observations;\ntwo_filter_smoother() to implement particle smoothing;\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#Patter.r_get","page":"Patter.jl","title":"Patter.r_get","text":"R from Julia\n\nA collection of internal functions that facilitate the translation of Julia objects into R. \n\nDetails\n\nPatter.r_get_dataset() translates a Dictionary of observations into a Vector of DataFrames that can be passed to R.\nPatter.r_get_states() translates a Matrix of States into a DataFrame that can be passed to R.

Methods can be defined for new sub-types, such as ModelObsDepthNormal, as follows:\n\nfunction Patter.simulate_obs(state::StateXYZD, model_obs::ModelObsDepthNormal, t::Int64)\n    dbn   = truncated(Normal(state.z, model_obs.depth_sigma), 0, state.map_value)\n    rand(dbn)\nend\n\nPatter.simulate_obs() is wrapped by simulate_yobs() for the simulation of observations.\n\nLog probabilities\n\nPatter.logpdf_obs() is a generic function that calculates the log probability (density) of an observation, given the animal's State and a ModelObs instance. This accepts the following arguments:\n\nstate: A State instance;\nmodel_obs: A ModelObs instance;\nt: An integer that defines the time step;\nobs: The observation;\n\nMethods are implemented for all built-in sub-types. Methods can be defined for new sub-types, such as ModelObsDepthNormal, as follows:\n\nfunction Patter.logpdf_obs(state::State, model_obs::ModelObsDepthNormal, t::Int64, obs::Float64)\n    dbn   = truncated(Normal(state.map_value, model_obs.depth_sigma),\n                      0.0, state.map_value)\n    logpdf(dbn, obs)\n  end\n\nPatter.logpdf_obs() is used in particle_filter() to evaluate the log-probability of the data given particle samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Patter.State","page":"Patter.jl","title":"Patter.State","text":"State\n\nState is an Abstract Type that defines the animal's state at a given time step. \n\nBuilt-in sub-types\n\nThe following sub-types are built-in:\n\nStateXY(map_value, x, y): Used for two dimensional (x, y) states ;\nStateXYZD(map_value, x, y, z, angle): Used for four-dimensional (x, y, z, direction) states;\n\nThese contain the following fields: \n\nmap_value: The value of the movement map at coordinates (x, y), required for all States (see ModelMove);\nx, y:  Floats that define the animal's x and y coordinates, required for all States;\nz: A float that defines the animal's z (depth) coordinate, required for all States with a depth component;\nangle: A float that defines the turning angle, required by StateXYZD;\n\nCustom sub-types\n\nTo define a custom sub-type, such as StateXYZ, simply define a struct that is a sub-type of Patter.State:\n\nstruct StateXYZ <: Patter.State\n    #
