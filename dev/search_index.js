Patter.simulate_move() is an iterative wrapper for a Patter.simulate_step() method that simulates a new State instance from the previous State, using the movement model. Patter.simulate_move() implements Patter.simulate_step() iteratively until a legal move is found (or .n_move is reached). Illegal moves are those that land in NaN locations on the map or, in the case of states that include a depth (z) component, are below the depth of the seabed. Particles that fail to generate legal moves are eventually killed by re-sampling (see below).\n\nLikelihood\n\nFor each valid State and time stamp in yobs, the log-probability of each observation, given the State, is evaluated via Patter.logpdf_obs(). The maximum log-probability across all particles is recorded at each time step as an algorithm diagnostic.\n\nResampling\n\nParticles are periodically re-sampled, with replacement, using the low-variance systematic re-sampling algorithm (via resample()), when the effective sample size is less than or equal to .n_resample. This has the effect of eliminating impossible particles and duplicating likely ones.\n\nThe algorithm continues in this way, iterating over the timeline, simulating, weighting and (re)sampling particles. At each time step, .n_record particles are saved in memory. If the function fails to converge, a [warning] is returned alongside the outputs up to that time step. Otherwise, the function will continue to the end of the time series.\n\nMulti-threading\n\nThe iteration over particles (i.e., simulated movements and likelihood evaluations) are multi-threaded. \n\nConvergence and diagnostics\n\nAlgorithm convergence is not guaranteed. The algorithm may reach a dead-end–-a time step at which there are no valid locations into which the algorithm can step. This may be due to data errors, incorrect assumptions, insufficient sampling effort or poor tuning-parameter settings.\n\nReturns\n\nA NamedTuple with the following fields:\n\ntimesteps: An Vector{Int64} of time steps;\ntimestamps: The timeline;\ndirection: The direction;\nstate: A Matrix of States:\nEach row corresponds to a particle; \nEach column corresponds to the timestep;\ness: A Vector{Float64} that defines the effective sample size at each time step;\nmaxlp: A Vector{Float64} that defines the maximum log-posterior at each time step;\nconvergence: A Bool that defines whether or not the algorithm reached the end of the timeline;\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#Patter.r_get_states","page":"Patter.jl","title":"Patter.r_get_states","text":"R from Julia\n\nA collection of functions that facilitate the translation of inputs from Julia into R. \n\nDetails\n\n[r_get_states] translates a State matrix into a DataFrame that can be passed to R.

Methods can be defined for new sub-types, such as ModelObsDepthNormal, as follows:\n\nfunction Patter.simulate_obs(state::StateXYZD, model::ModelObsDepthNormal, t::Int64)\n    dbn   = truncated(Normal(state.z, model.depth_sigma), 0, state.map_value)\n    rand(dbn)\nend\n\nPatter.simulate_obs() is wrapped by simulate_yobs() for the simulation of observations.\n\nLog probabilities\n\nPatter.logpdf_obs() is a generic function that calculates the log probability (density) of an observation, given the animal's State and a ModelObs instance. This accepts the following arguments:\n\nstate: A State instance;\nmodel: A ModelObs instance;\nt: An integer that defines the time step;\nobs: The observation;\n\nMethods are implemented for all built-in sub-types. Methods can be defined for new sub-types, such as ModelObsDepthNormal, as follows:\n\nfunction Patter.logpdf_obs(state::State, model::ModelObsDepthNormal, t::Int64, obs::Float64)\n    dbn   = truncated(Normal(state.map_value, model.depth_sigma),\n                      0.0, state.map_value)\n    logpdf(dbn, obs)\n  end\n\nPatter.logpdf_obs() is used in particle_filter() to evaluate the log-probability of the data given particle samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Patter.State","page":"Patter.jl","title":"Patter.State","text":"State\n\nState is an abstract type that defines the animal's state at a given time step. \n\nSubtypes\n\nStateXY: Used for two dimensional (x, y) states;\nStateXYZ: Used for three-dimensional (x, y, z) states;\nStateXYZD: Used for four-dimensional (x, y, z, direction) states;\n\nFields\n\nmap_value: The value of the map at coordinates (x, y), required for All States;\nx, y:  The animal's x and y coordinates, required for all States;\nz: The animal's z coordinate, required for 3D States;\nangle: The turning angle, required by StateXYZD;\n\nDetails\n\nAll states must include x, y and map_value fields;\nFor >= 3D states, the depth dimension must be named z (for Patter.simulate_move());\nFor R users, all fields must be of type Float64 for Patter.r_get_states() to parse state vectors;\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Patter.StateXY","page":"Patter.jl","title":"Patter.StateXY","text":"State\n\nState is an abstract type that defines the animal's state at a given time step. \n\nSubtypes\n\nStateXY: Used for two dimensional (x, y) states;\nStateXYZ: Used for three-dimensional (x, y, z) states;\nStateXYZD: Used for four-dimensional (x, y, z, direction) states;\n\nFields\n\nmap_value: The value of the map at coordinates (x, y), required for All States;\nx, y:  The animal's x and y coordinates, required for all States;\nz: The animal's z coordinate, required for 3D States;\nangle: The turning angle, required by StateXYZD;\n\nDetails\n\nAll states must include x, y and map_value fields;\nFor >= 3D states, the depth dimension must be named z (for Patter.simulate_move());\nFor R users, all fields must be of type Float64 for Patter.r_get_states() to parse state vectors;\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Patter.StateXYZ","page":"Patter.jl","title":"Patter.StateXYZ","text":"State\n\nState is an abstract type that defines the animal's state at a given time step. \n\nSubtypes\n\nStateXY: Used for two dimensional (x, y) states;\nStateXYZ: Used for three-dimensional (x, y, z) states;\nStateXYZD: Used for four-dimensional (x, y, z, direction) states;\n\nFields\n\nmap_value: The value of the map at coordinates (x, y), required for All States;\nx, y:  The animal's x and y coordinates, required for all States;\nz: The animal's z coordinate, required for 3D States;\nangle: The turning angle, required by StateXYZD;\n\nDetails\n\nAll states must include x, y and map_value fields;\nFor >= 3D states, the depth dimension must be named z (for Patter.simulate_move());\nFor R users, all fields must be of type Float64 for Patter.r_get_states() to parse state vectors;\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Patter.StateXYZD","page":"Patter.jl","title":"Patter.StateXYZD","text":"State\n\nState is an abstract type that defines the animal's state at a given time step. \n\nSubtypes\n\nStateXY: Used for two dimensional (x, y) states;\nStateXYZ: Used for three-dimensional (x, y, z) states;\nStateXYZD: Used for four-dimensional (x, y, z, direction) states;\n\nFields\n\nmap_value: The value of the map at coordinates (x, y), required for All States;\nx, y:  The animal's x and y coordinates, required for all States;\nz: The animal's z coordinate, required for 3D States;\nangle: The turning angle, required by StateXYZD;\n\nDetails\n\nAll states must include x, y and map_value fields;\nFor >= 3D states, the depth dimension must be named z (for Patter.simulate_move());\nFor R users, all fields must be of type Float64 for Patter.r_get_states() to parse state vectors;\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Index","page":"Patter.jl","title":"Index","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Patter.jl","title":"Patter.jl","text":"","category":"page"}]
