In our applications, map is often a bathymetry raster that defines the depth of the seabed across the study area. map is an essential field in individual movement models (see ModelMove). The internal extract() function supports the simulation of initial states (via simulate_states_init()) and the updating of states (via Patter.simulate_step()), as required to simulate animal movement paths (e.g., in simulate_path_walk() and particle_filter()). Individual states define, at a minimum, the individual's location (x, y) and the value of the map at that location (map_value), which is extracted by extract() (see State). The Coordinate Reference Systems for map, x and y must align for this to work (i.e., map should use a Universal Transverse Mercator projection with coordinates in metres). extract() is exported so that it can be used in new methods (for custom states or movement models) of these functions. The simulation of individual movements (via Patter.simulate_step()) is implemented iteratively (via Patter.simulate_move()) until a valid movement is found. NaN is taken to define inhospitable habitats, such as land, into which the individual cannot move (see is_valid()). It should be possible to use a map in another format (such as a shapefile) within these routines, with a custom extract() method that returns NaN in inhospitable habitats and a numeric constant otherwise. \n\nReturns\n\nThe value of the GeoArray for a coordinate pair within the bounds of map;\nNaN (of the same type as map's elements) for a coordinate pair beyond the bounds of map;\n\nSee also\n\nState for State sub-types;\nPatter.extract() to extract values from map at State coordinates;\nPatter.simulate_step() to simulate a new State;\nPatter.is_valid() to determine whether or not a simulated state is valid;\nPatter.simulate_move() to simulate states iteratively until a valid state is found;\nsimulate_path_walk() and particle_filter() for the front-end functions that use these routines to simulate animal movement paths;\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#Patter.is_valid","page":"Patter.jl","title":"Patter.is_valid","text":"is_valid(map_value::Real)\nis_valid(map_value::Real, z::Real)\n\n(Internal) Determine the validity of a point on a map.\n\nFor two-dimensional (x, y) states, is_valid(map_value) checks if the map_value (at a point (x, y)) is not NaN.\n\nFor states with a depth (z) component, is_valid(map_value, z), checks that map_value is not NaN and that the provided z-coordinate (z) lies within the valid range, specifically 0 < z ≤ map_value (i.e., the animal is not below the seabed).\n\nArguments\n\nmap_value: The value of the map in a particular location;\nz: (optional) The z-coordinate (depth) of the animal, used for states that contain a depth component only;\n\nDetails\n\nThese are internal functions.

Otherwise, a Monte Carlo simulation of n_sim iterations is used to estimate the normalisation constant. A Beta(1, 1) prior is used to correct for simulations that fail to generate valid move from state.

If enabled, one progress bar is shown for each batch;\nverbose: A Bool that defines whether or not to print information to the console;\n\nAlgorithm\n\nInitiation\n\nThe algorithm is initiated using a Vector of n_particle States (xinit). See simulate_states_init() to simulate initial states for the filter.\n\nMovement\n\nFor every time step in the timeline, the internal function Patter.simulate_move() simulates the movement of particles away from previous States into new States using the movement model, as specified by model_move. Patter.simulate_move() is an iterative wrapper for a Patter.simulate_step() method that simulates a new State instance from the previous State. Patter.simulate_move() implements Patter.simulate_step() iteratively until a legal move is found (or n_move is reached). For custom State or ModelObs sub-types, a corresponding Patter.simulate_step() method is required. Illegal moves are those that land in NaN locations on the map or, in the case of States that include a depth (z) component, are below the depth of the seabed (see is_valid()). Particles that fail to generate legal moves are eventually killed by re-sampling (see below).\n\nLikelihood\n\nObservations are used to weight simulated particles. To simulate observations for filtering, use simulate_yobs(). To assemble real-world observations for filtering, see assemble_yobs(). For each valid State and time stamp in yobs, the log-probability of each observation, given the State, is evaluated via Patter.logpdf_obs(). For custom State or ModelObs sub-types, a corresponding Patter.logpdf_obs() method is required. The maximum weight across all particles (maxlp) is recorded at each time step as an algorithm diagnostic. (This metric can be intepreted as the maximum log-posterior if resampling is implemented at every time step.)\n\nResampling\n\nParticles are periodically re-sampled, with replacement, using the low-variance systematic re-sampling algorithm (via Patter.resample()), at time steps in t_resample or when the effective sample size is less than or equal to n_resample. This has the effect of eliminating impossible particles and duplicating likely ones.\n\nThe algorithm continues in this way, iterating over the timeline, simulating, weighting and (re)sampling particles. At each time step, n_record particles are saved in memory. If the function fails to converge, a warning is returned alongside the outputs up to that time step. Otherwise, the function will continue to the end of the time series.\n\nMulti-threading\n\nThe iteration over particles (i.e., simulated movements and likelihood evaluations) are multi-threaded.\n\nMemory management\n\nBy default, n_record particles at each time step are retained in memory. If batch is provided, the timeline is split into length(batch) batches. The filter still moves along the whole timeline, but only records the particles for the current batch in memory. At the end of each batch, the particles for that batch are written to file. This reduces total memory demand. \n\nbatch file paths are sorted alphanumerically if direction = \"forward\" and in reverse order if direction = \"backward\". For example: \n\nIf you have a timeline of 10 time steps, direction = \"forward\" and batch = [\"fwd-1.jld2\", \"fwd-2.jld2\", \"fwd-3.jld2\"], fwd-1.jld2, fwd-2.jld2 and fwd-3.jld2 contain the particle matrices for time steps [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] and [7, 8, 9, 10], respectively. \nIf you have a timeline of 10 time steps, direction = \"backward\" and batch = [\"bwd-1.jld2\", \"bwd-2.jld2\", \"bwd-3.jld2\"], bwd-1.jld2, bwd-2.jld2 and bwd-3.jld2 similarly contain the particle matrices for time steps [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] and [7, 8, 9, 10], respectively. \n\nConvergence and diagnostics\n\nAlgorithm convergence is not guaranteed. The algorithm may reach a dead-end–-a time step at which there are no valid locations into which the algorithm can step. This may be due to data errors, incorrect assumptions, insufficient sampling effort or poor tuning-parameter settings.\n\nReturns\n\nA Particles structure;\n\nSee also\n\nState, ModelMove and ModelObs for State, movement model and observation model sub-types;\nsimulate_yobs() and assemble_yobs() to prepare observations for the particle filter;\nPatter.simulate_step() and Patter.simulate_move() for the internal routines used to simulate new States;\nPatter.logpdf_obs() methods to evaluate the log probability of observations;\nparticle_smoother_two_filter() to implement particle smoothing;\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#Patter.particle_smoother_two_filter-Tuple{}","page":"Patter.jl","title":"Patter.particle_smoother_two_filter","text":"particle_smoother_two_filter(; timeline::Vector{DateTime}, \n                               xfwd::Union{Matrix{<:State}, Vector{String}}, \n                               xbwd::Union{Matrix{<:State}, Vector{String}}, \n                               model_move::ModelMove, \n                               vmap::Union{GeoArray, Nothing} = nothing, \n                               n_sim::Int = 100, \n                               n_particle::Union{Nothing, Int} = nothing,\n                               cache::Bool = true, \n                               batch::Union{Nothing, Vector{String}} = nothing, \n                               progress = true, \n                               verbose::Bool = true)\n\nA two-filter particle smoother that samples from f(s_t | y_{1:T}) for t ∈ 1:T.\n\nArguments (keywords)\n\ntimeline: A Vector{DateTime} of ordered, regularly spaced time stamps that defines the time steps for the simulation;\nxfwd, xbwd: Particles from the forward and backward filters (see particle_filter()), supplied as:\nA Matrix of States (in memory);\nA Vector of file paths, if particle_filter() was implemented with batch;\nmodel_move: A ModelMove instance;\nvmap: (optional) A GeoArray that defines the 'validity map' (see Patter.logpdf_move());\nn_sim: An integer that defines the number of Monte Carlo simulations (see Patter.logpdf_move());\n(optional) n_particle: An integer that defines the number of particles for smoothing.

The timeline from the particle filter should be supplied as well as a Matrix of particles from a forward run and a backward run (or a Vector of file paths to those matrices). The two filter smoother works by iteratively resampling particles in line with the probability density of movement between particles from the backward filter at time t and particles from the forward filter at time t - 1. Patter.logpdf_move() is an internal function that evaluates the log probability of a movement step between particles. This function wraps the Patter.logpdf_step() generic. Methods are provided for built-in State and ModelMove sub-types. To use custom sub-types, a corresponding Patter.logpdf_step() method should be provided. In particle_smoother_two_filter(), the vmap and n_sim arguments support the calculate of probability densities (see Patter.logpdf_move()). For movement models for which the density only depends on fields in xbwd and xfwd, set cache = true to precompute and store normalisation constants for density calculations for unique xbwd elements. Note that since typically only a subsample of particles from particle_filter() are retained in memory, it is not guaranteed that valid moves will exist between particle pairs at all time steps. At time step(s) in which the two filters are incompatible, 50 % of particles are retained from the forward filter and 50 % from the backward filter with a warning. The effective sample size at such time steps is set to NaN, providing an index and counter for problematic time steps (see Returns). Batching is only implemented if the inputs (xfwd, and xbwd) and outputs (via batch) are batched (and contain the same number of batches). \n\nReturns\n\nA Particles structure;\n\nSee also\n\nparticle_filter() implements the particle filter;\nPatter.logpdf_step(), logpdf_move_normalisation() and Patter.logpdf_move() evaluate the log probability (density) of movement between two States;\nparticle_smoother_two_filter() implements the two-filter particle smoother;\n\nSource\n\nFearnhead, P., Wyncoll, D., Tawn, J., 2010.

Containers are a computational device used to mitigate particle degeneracy in the particle filter. Containers define the maximum possible distance of an individual from a location (e.g., receiver) that recorded a future observation. Accordingly, the ModelObsContainer structure contains the following fields:\n\nsensor_id: An integer that defines the sensor ID (e.g., the receiver ID for the receiver that recorded the next detection);\ncentroid_x, centroid_y: Floats that define the x and y coordinates of the container's centroid;\nradius: A Float that defines the radius of the container; \n\nAn acoustic container defines the region within which an individual must be located according to the receiver(s) at which it was next detected. In the particle filter, particles are permitted or killed depending on whether or not they are compatible with this constraint.\n\nWe formalise the acoustic container constraint as follows. Let t denote the movement timeline (where t in 12 dots T), boldsymbols denote the individual's latent state (typically (x,y) location), boldsymboly denote acoustic observations (detections, non-detections) at receivers and boldsymboltheta denote static parameters (in the movement and observation models). The likelihood of the observations boldsymboly_1T given the parameters boldsymboltheta is expressed as\n\nf(boldsymboly_1Tmidboldsymboltheta) =\nint\nprod_t=1^T\nf(boldsymboly_tmidboldsymbols_tboldsymboltheta)\n f(boldsymbols_tmidboldsymbols_t-1boldsymboltheta)\n dboldsymbols_1T\n\nAcoustic containerisation represents a redefinition of the likelihood f(boldsymboly_tmidboldsymbols_tboldsymboltheta), in a manner that does not affect the likelihood f(boldsymboly_1Tmidboldsymboltheta), with the addition of a characteristic function chi(tboldsymbols_tboldsymboly) in 01 that returns zero or one depending on whether or not the latent state boldsymbols_t is compatible with the observations at some future time:\n\nf(boldsymboly_1Tmidboldsymboltheta) =\nint\nprod_t=1^T\nf(boldsymboly_tmidboldsymbols_tboldsymboltheta)\n chi(tboldsymbols_tboldsymboly)\n f(boldsymbols_tmidboldsymbols_t-1boldsymboltheta)\n dboldsymbols_1T\n\nThe characteristic function chi(tboldsymbols_tboldsymboly) is defined as follows.   Let Delta(t) be a function that identifies the next time step (at some time after t) at which detection(s) were recorded.   At time t the individual must be within a maximum distance (denoted textradius_k) of each receiver k that recorded the next detection(s):\n\nchi(tboldsymbols_tboldsymboly) =\nprod_k\nchi_kbigl(\nlVert boldsymbolr_kDelta(t) - boldsymbols_t rVert\nle textradius_k(textmobility)\nbigr)\n\nwhere boldsymbolr_kDelta(t) denotes the location of receiver k.\n\nThe radius for receiver k at time t depends on the number of time steps from t until the detection event (Delta(t)-t), a parameter textmobility in boldsymboltheta that defines the maximum possible moveable distance in between two time steps (i.e., from t to t+1) and the receiver’s maximum detection range gamma in boldsymboltheta:\n\ntextradius(textmobility) =\n(Delta(t)-t)textmobility + gamma\n\nIn practice, acoustic containers are implemented via the ModelObsContainer structure (that is, we treat the container like an additional observation, even though it is simply a redundant use of the data).  ModelObsContainer instances must be assembled before the filter run, following the equations above. For relevant time steps, it is necessary to build a ModelObsContainer for each of the receiver(s) that recorded a detection at the next detection time step. Each instance contains centroid_x and centroid_y elements that define the centroid of the container and a radius element that defines the maximum possible distance of the individual from the container centroid (see above).\n\nIn the particle filter, at each time t, we iterate over all observation‑model structures and update particle weights using a Patter.logpdf_obs method. For ModelObsContainer instances, the Patter.logpdf_obs method computes the distance between the particle (i) and receiver k’s location (centroid) and adds 00 or text-Inf to the log weight (textlw) depending on whether or not the distance is less than the radius:\n\ntextlw_i =\ntextlw_i +\nlogbigl(\nchi_kbigl(\nlVert boldsymbolr_kDelta(t) - boldsymbols_t rVert\nle textradius_k(textmobility)\nbigr)\nbigr)\n\nThis approach is valid because we only kill particles that are incompatible with future observations. A filtering–smoothing algorithm that implements acoustic containerisation thus still approximates f(boldsymbols_tmidboldsymboly_1T) once all data have been taken into account.\n\nCustom sub-types\n\nTo define a custom sub-type, such as ModelObsDepthNormal, simply define a struct that is a sub-type of Patter.ModelObs:\n\nstruct ModelObsDepthNormal <: Patter.ModelObs\n    sensor_id::Int64\n    depth_sigma::Float64\nend\n\nFor communication with R, all sub-types should include a sensor_id field. \n\nAdd corresponding methods to simulate observations via Patter.simulate_obs() and to evaluate log probabilities via Patter.logpdf_obs(). \n\nSimulation\n\nPatter.simulate_obs() is an internal generic function that simulates observations, given the animal's State and a ModelObs instance.
