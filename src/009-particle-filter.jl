    resample(w::Vector{Float64}, n::Int)

Given a weight vector `w`, resample a set of *indices* based on low-variance resampling algorithm from Thrun, Burgard and Fox's "Probabilistic Robotics".

# Arguments

- `w`: A `Vector{Float64}` of weights;
- `n`: An integer that defines the number of particles;

# Details

This is an internal function that implements systematic resampling in the particle filter (see [`particle_filter()`](@ref)) and smoothing algorithms (see [`two_filter_smoother()`](@ref)). Note that for large `n`, the function is not numerically stable.

# Returns

- An integer vector of indices;

# Example

```Julia
X = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
w = [0, 0, 0.75, 0.25]

idx = resample(w, 12)
X[idx]
```

# Particle filter

A particle filtering algorithm that samples from `f(X_t | {Y_1 ... Y_t}) for t ∈ 1:t`.

# Arguments (keywords)

- `timeline`: A `Vector{DateTime}` of ordered, regularly spaced time stamps that defines the time steps for the simulation;
- `xinit`: A `Vector` of [`State`](@ref) instances that defines the initial state(s) of the animal;
- `yobs`: A Dictionary of observations:
  - Dictionary keys should match elements in `timeline`;
  - Each element must be a `Vector` of `Tuple`s for that time step (one for each observation/sensor);
  - Each `Tuple` should contain (a) the observation and (b) the model parameters (that is, a [`ModelObs`](@ref) instance);
- `model_move`: A [`ModelMove`](@ref) instance:
    - The movement model describes movement from one time step to the next and therefore depends implicitly on the resolution of `timeline`;
    - The movement model should align with the [`State`](@ref) instances in `xinit`. For example, a two-dimensional state ([`StateXY`](@ref)) requires a corresponding movement model instance (i.e., [`ModelMoveXY`](@ref));
- `n_move`: An integer that defines the number of attempts used to find a legal move;
    - All [`ModelMove`](@ref) sub-types contain a `map` field that defines the region(s) within which movements are allowed (see [`is_valid()`](@ref));
    - Each particle is moved up to `n_move` times, until a valid movement is simulated;
    - Particles that fail to generate a valid move are killed;
- `n_record`: An integer that defines the number of particles to record at each time step:
    - `n_record` particles are resampled at each time step and recorded in memory;
- `n_resample`: A number that defines the effective sample size for resampling:
    - Particles are resampled when the effective sample size <= `n_resample`;
- `direction:` A `String` that defines the direction of the filter:
    - `"forward"` runs the filter forwards in time;
    - `"backward"` runs the filter backwards in time;

# Algorithm

## Initiation

The algorithm is initiated using a `Vector` of `n_particle` [`State`](@ref)s (`xinit`). See [`simulate_states_init()`](@ref) to simulate initial states for the filter.

## Movement

For every time step in the `timeline`, the internal function [`Patter.simulate_move()`](@ref) simulates the movement of particles away from previous [`State`](@ref)s into new [`State`](@ref)s using the movement model, as specified by `model_move`. [`Patter.simulate_move()`](@ref) is an iterative wrapper for a [`Patter.simulate_step()`](@ref) method that simulates a new [`State`](@ref) instance from the previous [`State`](@ref). [`Patter.simulate_move()`](@ref) implements [`Patter.simulate_step()`](@ref) iteratively until a legal move is found (or `n_move` is reached). For custom [`State`](@ref) or [`ModelObs`](@ref) sub-types, a corresponding [`Patter.simulate_step()`](@ref) method is required. Illegal moves are those that land in `NaN` locations on the `map` or, in the case of [`State`](@ref)s that include a depth (`z`) component, are below the depth of the seabed (see [`is_valid()`](@ref)). Particles that fail to generate legal moves are eventually killed by re-sampling (see below).

## Likelihood

Observations are used to weight simulated particles. To simulate observations for filtering, use [`simulate_yobs()`](@ref). To assemble real-world observations for filtering, see [`assemble_yobs()`](@ref). For each valid [`State`](@ref) and time stamp in `yobs`, the log-probability of each observation, given the [`State`](@ref), is evaluated via [`logpdf_obs()`](@ref). For custom [`State`](@ref) or [`ModelObs`](@ref) sub-types, a corresponding [`logpdf_obs()`](@ref) method is required. The maximum weight across all particles (`maxlp`) is recorded at each time step as an algorithm diagnostic. (This metric can be intepreted as the maximum log-posterior if resampling is implemented at every time step.)

## Resampling

Particles are periodically re-sampled, with replacement, using the low-variance systematic re-sampling algorithm (via [`resample()`](@ref)), when the effective sample size is less than or equal to `n_resample`. This has the effect of eliminating impossible particles and duplicating likely ones.

The algorithm continues in this way, iterating over the `timeline`, simulating, weighting and (re)sampling particles. At each time step, `n_record` particles are saved in memory. If the function fails to converge, a warning is returned alongside the outputs up to that time step. Otherwise, the function will continue to the end of the time series.

## Multi-threading

The iteration over particles (i.e., simulated movements and likelihood evaluations) are multi-threaded.

## Convergence and diagnostics

Algorithm convergence is not guaranteed. The algorithm may reach a dead-end---a time step at which there are no valid locations into which the algorithm can step. This may be due to data errors, incorrect assumptions, insufficient sampling effort or poor tuning-parameter settings.

# Returns

- A `NamedTuple` with the following fields:
    - `timesteps`: An `Vector{Int64}` of time steps;
    - `timestamps`: The `timeline`;
    - `direction`: The `direction`;
    - `state`: A `Matrix` of [`State`](@ref)s:
        - Each row corresponds to a particle;
        - Each column corresponds to the `timestep`;
    - `ess`: A `Vector{Float64}` that defines the effective sample size at each time step;
    - `maxlp`: A `Vector{Float64}` that defines the maximum log weight at each time step (i.e., the maximum log-posterior, if resampling is implemented at every time step);
    - `convergence`: A `Boolian` that defines whether or not the algorithm reached the end of the `timeline`;
    - `trials`: An integer that defines the number of trials (1);
